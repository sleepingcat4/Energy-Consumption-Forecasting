# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting
Machine Learning model created through prophet to predict

# Introduction

The project uses an Open Source Machine Learning Library known as "Prophet" that was released by Meta. It specializes in forecasting data on time series basis. 

## Why this project?

Energy wastage is a serious issue. Billions of USD worth Energy are being wasted each year. If a forecasting system is put into place to predict what'll be the upcoming energy consumption. 
Energy giants can efficiently produce energy which in result would lead to more energy savings in dollar and reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere that was produced in the process of generating that wasted energy previously!

This project hopes to solve excessive CO2 emission and wastage of energy problem through this machine learning model.
